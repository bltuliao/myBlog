              My name is Bianca and I'm a software engineer from Philadelphia. Most recently, I was a software engineer at QVC and built applications within the supply chain domain.
              I graduated from Temple University with a bachelors in [Information Science and Technology](https://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/science-technology/computer-information-science/information-science-technology-bs/#text).
             <br /> <br />I grew up in the 'burbs of Chicago and am a big fan of Lou Malnati's for a delicious deep dish pizza. When I'm not at my computer I'm most likely discovering new restaurants,
             reading, or crocheting.
